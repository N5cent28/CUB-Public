This report was produced from a John Hopkins COVID-19 Dataset and accessed via GitHub. It contains a list of countries/regions and their reported confirmed COVID-19 case numbers each day through the majority of the pandemic. 

The dataset from which this graphic was sourced can be found here: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/raw/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv
*note: code for data manipulation can be found in the appendix
