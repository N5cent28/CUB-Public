# CU Boulder Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects completed during my Master's in Data Science program at the University of Colorado Boulder. The projects showcase various aspects of data science including machine learning, deep learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

## Projects

### Deep Learning
- **Disaster Tweet Classification**: NLP model to classify tweets as disaster-related or not using various approaches including LSTM, Word2Vec, and GloVe embeddings.
- **Histopathologic Cancer Detection**: Deep learning model for identifying metastatic tissue in histopathologic scans using CNN architectures.
- **Chest CT Cancer Classification**: Transfer learning approach using VGG16 for classifying different types of lung cancer from CT scans.
- **GAN Dog Image Generation**: Generative Adversarial Network implementation for synthetic dog image generation using the Stanford Dogs Dataset.

### Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Revenue prediction model using Random Forest with feature engineering and outlier detection.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Analysis of GRHL2 protein-DNA binding patterns using clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction.

### Data Analysis & Visualization
- **COVID-19 Analysis**: R-based analysis of early COVID-19 pandemic data, including visualizations of case numbers and correlation with government control measures.
